# Helpful resources when learning Julia

Here is a collection of resources that I found helpful when learning Julia. I hope some of them are helpful for you as well. I will continue adding to this page as I find more helpful resources.

* [Discourse forums](https://discourse.julialang.org/) - While the Julia language has a presence on the JuliaLang [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/julia-lang), I find the Discourse forums to be more helpful and friendly than StackOverflow. The Julia community is extremely welcoming to newcomers, inviting them to participate in any and all discussions about the language, and eagerly answering any questions they may have.
