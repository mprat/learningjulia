The purpose of the this blog is to document my journey in learning the [Julia](http://julialang.org/) programming language. As a previous MATLAB and Python / numpy user for many years, I am interested in bringing the best of the Julia language into my work.

I graduated from [MIT](http://web.mit.edu) in 2013 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, then worked for 1 year in Jerusalem teaching beginner Python for an [NGO](http://meet.mit.edu). In 2015 I graduated from MIT with my Masters of Engineering with a focus in computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning. I worked for 1 year at a vision startup doing large-scale visual recognition, and currently work at Amazon as a research scientst. (You can read even more about me and my work on my [personal home page](http://mprat.org).)

As of January 2017, I use [Python](http://python.org) and [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) daily in my research, and am looking for a way to multiply my effectiveness. Julia seems a perfect fit. [Friends](http://blog.robindeits.com/) have been encouraging me to learn Julia (it was invented at MIT no less!), and this blog is a great way for me to share that experience with the rest of the internet, and will provide motivation for me to actually do it!

If you have any ideas for projects for me to do, libraries for me to look at, or interesting content you want to see on this site, feel free to <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">send me an email</a>.

Enjoy!
