The purpose of the this blog is to document my journey in learning the [Julia](http://julialang.org/) programming language. As a previous MATLAB and Python / numpy user for many years, I am interested in bringing the best of the Julia language into my work.

I am a computer vision research scientist. I use [Python](http://python.org) and [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) daily in my research, and am looking for a way to multiply my effectiveness. In the image processing and computer vision domain, I am constantly frustrated by having to remember that my images are "RGB" rather than "BGR", and that x- and y- indices in images are constantly backwards. [Friends](http://blog.robindeits.com/) have been encouraging me to learn Julia to fix some of my biggest woes wiht Python and numpy. To avoid procrastinating on learning Julia, I decided to make this blog to document and share my experience. It will provide motivation for me to learn and hack around with Julia, documenting my entire progress.

If you have any ideas for projects for me to do, libraries for me to look at, or interesting content you want to see on this site, feel free to <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">send me an email</a>. I also do lots of things outside of computer vision, you can read more about me on [my personal blog](http://mprat.org).

Enjoy!
