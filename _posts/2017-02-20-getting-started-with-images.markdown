To get started with Julia, I wanted to learn more about the ecosystem of image support in Julia. Until now, my tools of choice for manipulating images was [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) in Python and [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/). Instead, Julia has the [JuliaImages](http://juliaimages.github.io/latest/) ecosystem of packages for image support.

Now I've included the notebook I used to install and play with basic images:

{% include notebook.html name='01-getting-started-with-images' %}

Any comments for me?
